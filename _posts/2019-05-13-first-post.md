I've just set up a new blog for cryptovoxels using github pages and jekyll (and based off my old [bennolan.com](//bennolan.com) blog). The goal is that you can subscribe to this feed to get a list of changes and improvements to Cryptovoxels, instead of having to trawl through hundreds of messages per day in the Discord.

I've also been using my iPad recently to explore the world, and then write my thoughts using [ia Writer](https://ia.net/writer), so I'm going to gather some of those broader thoughts and post them here.

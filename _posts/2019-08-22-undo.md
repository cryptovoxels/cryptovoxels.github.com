title: "Undo!"
---

At a users request (thanks Edmond!), I added Undo to the editor last night. When you're working on your parcel, all your edits are stored in an undo buffer, and if you make a mistake, just hit ctrl-z (or command-z on mac) to undo your edits. You can press undo multiple times. There is no redo button yet though, so be careful you don't go back too far.

Undo is per parcel, and acts on the parcel that you're currently standing in.

This works for the voxel field as well as features like signs, polytext. Now that I've started to add these key combos, I'm pretty keen to add copy-paste as well, so you can quickly duplicate signs / vox models around your parcel. This would be good for 'gardening' (as Jin puts it). ðŸ˜ƒ
